# NNCWO_mediators
Improving Causal effect estimation of weighted regression based estimator using neural networks under causal mediator settings. For this purpose, Synthetic data was generated from structural causal model (SCM). Then, ground truth was calculated using do calculus and estimation was caluculated for cwo and nncwo operator. Finally, we compared the results.
